      ### ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my blog!


      My name is Dmitry. I am a software engineer with more then 5 years of experience.


      Here, youâ€™ll find a mix of content â€” from deep dives into software design and architecture, to reflections on industry trends, to the occasional dev log where Iâ€™ll document the progress (and challenges) of my personal and pet projects. Whether itâ€™s a new framework Iâ€™m exploring, an engineering problem Iâ€™m puzzling over, or lessons learned from past experiences, this blog is my way of thinking out loud and connecting with others who share a passion for building things.
      

      If youâ€™re an engineer, a tech enthusiast, or just curious about the craft behind the code, I hope youâ€™ll find something here that sparks your interest.
